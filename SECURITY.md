## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please email us at rakinar2@onesoftnet.eu.org with proper information (like the version of the bot you're running, OS etc) and attachments, if needed. Please do not create an issue on GitHub or discuss about security issues publicly, that would cause more problem rather than solving it.
We might contact you again to investigate the issue if needed.
